# Python-Object-Detection
An application which detects objects in real time using the YOLO algorithm and the OpenCV library in Python
#
In this project, I implemented real-time object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm integrated with OpenCV in Python. The system identifies and labels multiple objects within an image or video stream with high accuracy and speed.
It is based off of the information found here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-detection-with-yolo-and-opencv/
